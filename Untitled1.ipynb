    "\n",
    "A generator function in Python is a special type of function that returns an iterator, which we can iterate over (one value at a time). Unlike a regular function that returns a single value, a generator function uses the `yield` keyword to yield a series of values one at a time, pausing and resuming its state between each yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `yield` Keyword is Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `yield` keyword is used in generator functions to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Produce a value**: Yield a value to the caller of the generator.\n",
    "2. **Pause the function's execution**: Maintain the function's state so it can resume right after the last `yield` run.\n",
    "3. **Memory Efficiency**: Handle large data sets efficiently by yielding items one at a time instead of returning a complete list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Generator Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a generator function that yields the first `n` even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def even_numbers(n):\n",
    "    num = 0\n",

    "    print(even)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the generator function**: The function `even_numbers(n)` is defined with a `while` loop that runs until `n` becomes 0. It starts with `num = 0` and yields even numbers by incrementing `num` by 2 in each iteration.\n",
    "2. **Yield the values**: The `yield num` statement yields the current value of `num` and pauses the function's execution, allowing it to resume from this point in the next iteration.\n",
    "3. **Using the generator**: When you call `even_numbers(5)`, it returns a generator object `gen`. Iterating over `gen` using a `for` loop prints the first 5 even numbers.\n",
